# Search-and-Sort-Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental search and sort algorithms, including Linear Search, Binary Search, and Insertion Sort. The project is designed for beginners and students who want to understand basic searching and sorting techniques.

# Features:
✅ Linear Search (Iterative)
✅ Binary Search (Recursive)
✅ Insertion Sort
✅ Function to check if an array is sorted
✅ Interactive search selection

# How to Use:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/anubhav9369/Search-and-Sort-Algorithms.git
cd Search-and-Sort-Algorithms

# Run the script and test the search functions:
python search_sort.py

# Example usage 
# Searching
search_obj = Search()
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(search_obj.linear_search(arr, 30))  # Output: 2

# Sorting
sort_obj = Sort([5, 3, 8, 1, 2])
sorted_arr = sort_obj.insertion_sort()
print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

# To-Do List:
1.Add Bubble Sort
2.Implement Iterative Binary Search
3.Add Unit Tests
